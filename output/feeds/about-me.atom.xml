My work was related not only to physics but also to statistical analyisis and software development
for experiments at the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) detector
at Large Hadron Collider. I was involved with my group in the search for the Higgs particle.
I think we have all done a great job to discover the Higgs boson in 2012.
As a final point of my &amp;quot;physics&amp;quot; story was the PhD thesis, which I defended with summa cum laude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I am investigating and developing the techniques of the machine learning.
Also I am a big fan of the Bayesian Statistics.
My current projects are related to the Device Fingerprinting,
Fraud Prevention System for online transactions and Predictive Customer Behavior Modeling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can visit my &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://bitbucket.org/iggy_floyd/"&gt;repository&lt;/a&gt; to look at my projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm interested in doing distance work in the field of the data analysis.
